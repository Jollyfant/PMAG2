              <b> Change Summary </b>
				<p> Fixes were made to virtual geomagnetic pole calculations. The relative VGP distribution and cutoff algorithm use an arbitrary virtual site at location (0, 0). For the relative VGP distribution this does not matter. However, it means that for correct interpretation, all specimens in a collection should come from geographically adjacent areas.

              <ul>
                <p> <b> Features </b>
                <li> Added VGP longitude, latitude to mean downloads CSV and JSON. This VGP is based on the mean of individual poles. It is not the VGP of the mean of directions which may differ slightly.
                <li> Added option to show tick labels to Zijderveld plot.
                <li> Added MAD angle in statistics portal directional tab CSV exporting. The MAD angle is only carried over from imported .col files since 2.2.1.
                <li> Added option in settings tab to overlay individual samples in the collection mean tab.
                <li> Added option in settings tab to set each mean collection to a random color.
                <li> Added format for University of Helsinki (using block orientation).
              </ul>

              <ul>
                <p> <b> Fixes </b>
                <li> Fixed tooltip of site mean VGP in geography portal. The tooltip showed the projected equal area inclination instead of true inclination.
                <li> Added disclaimer under the VGP distribution in the directions tab in the statistics portal to emphasize it is a relative distribution assuming a single site.
                <li> Fixed bug in great circle PCA in geographic and tectonic coordinates where the pole to the plane was presented antipodal. The convention is that the pole is presented as negative (this has no effect on results). 
                <li> Swapped line styles for lower (solid) and upper (dashed) GC in hemisphere plot. 
                <li> Changed ordering of directions, mean and ellipse. Mean and ellipse should be on top in equal area plots.
                <li> Fixed multiple problems with the Geological Survey of Finland format. Geographic coordinates were interpreted as specimen coordinates and some leading numerals were dropped reading the file. Data interpreted with this format before version 2.3.0 are therefore incorrect.
              </ul>

                <li> Added option when saving a new collection from data to normalise directions (normal, reversed, flip).
                <li> The map in the geography portal now supports loading and displaying of simple literature data distributions for plotting (confidence parachutes).
                <li> Added University of Rennes input format to the interpretation portal.
                <li> Added University of Montpellier input format to the interpretation portal.
                <li> Confidence ellipes in the statistics portal are now not-flipped to antipodal positions by default. You can re-enable this setting in the settings tab.

              <ul>
                <p> <b> Fixes </b>
                <li> Fixed UTF-8 exporting of combined PDF graphics.
                <li> Fixed issue in BCN2G routine with broken input (see #72).

              <b> Change Summary </b>
              <p> A bug in the Utrecht format where the intensity was not corrected for the sample volume was fixed. This error does not affect directional statistics. Specimens with this problem will be marked but may at a later stage be corrected.

              <ul>
                <p> <b> Features </b>
                <li> Added <a href="../fair">information</a> page that decribes how Paleomagnetism.org 2.0 implements the FAIR principles. 
              </ul>

              <ul>
                <p> <b> Fixes </b>
                <li> When reading Utrecht format files the sample volume was ignored in the intensity calculation. It is now calculated correctly for newly loaded specimens, and correctly displayed in the interpretation portal for old specimens. Specimens in the data library with input format <b>UTRECHT</b> and below version <b>2.0.1</b> are in <b>Am^2</b> and should be divided by the sample volume and brought to <b>µA/m</b>.
                <li> Fixed regression introduced by commit <b>94fa96dbda1742b0104e79feae548fed43dc8496</b> where the last step in Utrecht format for every specimen was not read.
                <li> Loading files from the Paleomagnetism.org 1.0.0 format now correctly sets the sample volume.
                <li> The y-axis of the intensity diagram was changed from <b>µA/m</b> to <b>fraction</b> when normalization is requested.
                <li> Fixed non-ASCII characters in exporting of single charts in <b>PDF</b>. Unicode support is not available for combined charts. We recommend exporting combined charts as <b>SVG</b>.
                <li> Intensity diagram is redrawn when option <i>normalize intensities</i> in the settings tab is changed.

              <li> The application is only accessible through HTTPS.
              <li> Added HTTP API to query data from the library at <a href="https://api.paleomagnetism.org">https://api.paleomagnetism.org</a>.
